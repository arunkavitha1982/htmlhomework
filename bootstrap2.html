                <p>the Founder of
                    this
                    institution rose from a humble beginning to shine like a luminous star. He succeeded in his mission
                    through his relentless hard work. Sri. V.J.K. Dass was born on 20th November 1921 in an agricultural
                    family in Kanyakumari district. He was the sixth child in the family of seven. He had his early
                    education at his native place. He did his M.A. in Mysore University. Our Founder already set his
                    mind on
                    a higher goal. He began each day with an outlook that opened doors and welcomed opportunities. The
                    free
                    spirit in him always plodded him to do something that would make his imprint felt by others. Sri.
                    Dass
                    served in military in the north for 15 years. At the age of 27, he got married to Kamala and settled
                    in
                    Chennai. He worked as manager in Murthy's Tutorial for 10 years and was also incharge for the exams
                    conducted by Open Universities. Besides this, he was an instructor for typewriting classes. He
                    enhanced
                    his English knowledge by regularly reading "The Hindu" newspaper and referring to the dictionary. He
                    got
                    the idea to start up his own tutorial and succeeded in establishing it with a good strength, which
                    continued for 10 years. At the time when there were only a few selected schools imparting English
                    Medium
                    Education, he started a small primary school at Alwarpet and many celebrities studied in this
                    school.
                    Prominent personalities like Sri.C.V.Raman and others have visited this school. The school was then
                    shifted adjacent to Stella Maris College and had a strength of 3000 children from LKG to 12th Std.
                    This
                    is the first CBSE school in Chennai. The school was later shifted to Adyar. Today the school bears
                    testimony to what an individual can achieve and contribute to the society as his legacy.</p>
